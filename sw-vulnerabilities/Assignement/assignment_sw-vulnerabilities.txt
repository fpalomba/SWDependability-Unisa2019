> General Notes and Recommendations:

- The pairs (paper-group) have been done based on the number of team members, i.e., larger groups have longer papers;
- The order of presentations follows the logical structure of the lecture; as such, group (4) will be the first presenting, followed by group (5), (2), etc.;
- Each group has 20 minutes for presenting, followed by 10 minutes of discussion. Every three presentations there will be a break. Please, bring your own adapters to avoid problems;
- Each member of a group should take part of the presentation; To ease the coordination of the activities, I highly recommend making slides using a Google Drive presentation;
- To allow other groups understanding the various parts of the lecture, I highly recommend making practical examples and discuss them during the presentation, e.g., the term "error" is not a synonym of "vulnerability": may you make an example to show how they are different?

>  Some Specific Recommendations:

- Groups (4) and (5): As mentioned above, please discuss examples to make clear the context of the problem;
- Group (2): Please, introduce CVE during your presentation;
- Group (6): Ideally, in your presentation you show an example demonstrating how different techniques work and what are the main differences among them;
- Group (1): Ideally, in your presentation you show how to setup and run one of the static analysis tools on JPacman (e.g., one of the best ones, according to the empirical analysis?).
